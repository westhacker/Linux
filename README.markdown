# DataStructure Demos and Examples

A collection of OS (LINUX) experiments I've created, now open source and on GitHub, so please go ahead and help me hack this resource in to a wealth of demos that other authors can learn from.

# Aim

* If a user can hit view source on the demo, then we've done our job
* All content is open source and just enjoy it
* Individual demos, if authored by someone other than [@westhacker](http://twitter.com) can be credited as appropriate

# Language

* C in Linux

# Content

* A program which can calculate the time consume of a certain process
* Parent and child process
* Shell command explainer
* Banker's Algorithm
* ReadWriteLock with semaphore and shared memory


# Thanks

Thanks for your reading and happy coding
